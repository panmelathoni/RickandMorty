    <pre class="text-container" >       Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by
      Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime
      Adult Swim programming block. The series follows the misadventures  
      of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful 
      grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic
      life and interdimensional adventures.

      Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, 
      Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing 
      the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated
      from an animated short parody film
      of Back to the Future, created by Roiland for Channel 101, 
      a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. 

      The series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.      
      The fourth season premiered on November 10, 2019, and consists of ten episodes. 
      A fifth season was confirmed in July 2020, as part of a long-term deal in
      May 2018 that ordered 70 new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.
      The fifth season will premiere on June 20, 2021 and will consist of ten episodes.</pre>
